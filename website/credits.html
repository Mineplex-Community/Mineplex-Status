                This Mineplex status page was created for educational purposes by two morons/high school students
                over the course of a weekend, looking to expand their knowledge in JavaScript (for the website) and Java
                (for the backend API) through a simple, but useful project.
                <br>
                <br>
                Like most of our projects, the Mineplex Status Page is (mostly) open source. Unfortunately, since our API uses
                private access tokens (and due to a lack of wanting to remove them), it is not publicly visible. However,
                you can <a class="affiliateLink" href="https://github.com/Mineplex-Community/Status">view the source code</a> to this website on GitHub.
                <br>
                <br>
                If you want to get in contact with us for whatever reason (to report issues, suggest features, or help out), we'd love to have you.
                Go ahead and
                <a class="affiliateLink" href="https://www.mineplex.com/groups/.427/">send us a message </a>
                through the Mineplex Forums and we'll get back to you when we can (hopefully).
                <br>

                We hope you enjoy our site,
                <br>
